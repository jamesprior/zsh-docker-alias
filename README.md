# zsh-docker-alias


## Intro (TL;DR)

With `zsh-docker-alias` the `rails`, `rake`, and `bundle` commands will first check and see if there's a running docker contianer that mounts the local folder.  If there is it will run the command in the container.  If no containers are found, it runs the command like normal.

    âžœ  docker-demo git:(master) âœ— rails test
     ðŸ“¦ intercepted call to rails, running 'docker exec -it docker-demo rails test'
    Run options: --seed 7060

### Installation


You can either source the `docker-alias.zsh` script directly in your `~/.zshrc` or install it as an Oh My Zsh Plugin

    ln -s $PWD/zsh-plugins/bp-pengie $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins

    # Next edit ~/.zshrc and update the plugins:
    plugins=(git bundler bp-pengie)



## Limitations

* If you want to auto-execute more commands in docker you need to edit the script directly
* If there are more than one containers that mount the current folder then only the computers know which one it will run in
* It does not work in subdirectories of mounted folders
